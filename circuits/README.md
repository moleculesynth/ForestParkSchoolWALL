Wall Circuits
=============

The schematics provided here are in [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) format.

* Power_Supply - Auxiliary power for I/O components
* LED_board_1  - Switching circuit for Green/White LED arrays (2 each)
* LED_board_2  - Switching circuit for Red LED arrays (4 total)
  Because board 2 uses PNP transistors, output _low_ turns LED _on_


Only the schematics are provided:  The Breadboard/PCB ascpects of the files are not placed or routed, as they would not physcially match the devices as-built.
