Board Design
============

The board consists of an artistic map of the state of Oregon, laid out using hexagons.

On the left (ocean) side are a "battery positive" terminal and six input types:
* Rotary potentiometer (knob)
* Linear potentiometer (slider)
* Photosensors (three)
* Digital (arcade-style) joystick
* Toggle switches (three)
* Force sensors (three)

On the right (mountain) side are "battery negative" terminal and six outputs:
* LED array (white)
* Motor (blue spinner)
* LED array (red)
* Motor (red spinner)
* LED array (green)
* Transducer (speaker)

The circuits allow any one of the input types to be connected to one fo the outputs using a series of wooden blocks to bridge across the intervening hexes.  When a full connection between the positive/input/output/negative conenction are made, the input will manipulate the output.

The board also has five large illuminated colored buttons (Red, Green, White, Blue, Yellow) that are associated with electroluminescent wire wrapped under the hexes.
