Programming
============

The Wall is powered by a single Intel Arduino 101 ("Curie"), which is programmed by using the stock Arduino IDE.  The libraries for the I/O expansion boards will need to be included in any sketch in order for the Wall to function correctly:
* Sparkfun SX1509 IO Expander
* Adafruit ADS1X15
* Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library

The Seeedstudio Grove I2C is not currently downloadable in the Libary manager, so the files for that component are included in libraries directory.
